# VSSM
The virtual smoke sensor module lets you simulate a smoke sensor right on your computer! I built it using Processing, a platform that makes it easy to design interactive visuals. You can watch particles float across the screen, mimicking smoke, and even adjust how the sensor behaves by tweaking various settings. Plus, it can communicate with other devices using  serial communication system. This program is perfect for learning, testing, or demonstrating how a smoke sensor works.
